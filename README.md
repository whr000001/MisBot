# MisBot

The official repository for the paper [*How Do Social Bots Participate in Misinformation Spread? A Comprehensive Dataset and Analysis*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09613), which is accepted in EMNLP 2025.

The homepage of MisBot: https://whr000001.github.io/MisBot/

We have published MisBot on Baidu Disk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1h7ga9yDBZ9JI4VQsXXptdQ?pwd=8dtl

Due to privacy concerns, we only upload the data after removing the private information. **If you have downloaded the previous version, please remove it and download the newest one.**

If you need the original data, please contact Herun Wan through *wanherun at stu.xjtu.edu.cn* and state the purpose of use.

## What you can get from MiSBot

Note that we modified MisBot slightly, so some statistics are slightly different from those reported in the paper.

- We have developed a crawler to collect related information from the Weibo platform. However, we cannot make this crawler public. If you are interested in it, please contact Herun Wan through *wanherun at stu.xjtu.edu.cn*.
- 99,874 annotated Weibo users that are annotated by human annotators, among them, there are 48,536 active users. You can employ it to develop and evaluate your own social bot detectors.
- 23,622 information instances from Weibo, where the misinformation and real information are clearly distinguished (the accuracy of a vanilla detector is 95.2%). Thus, we recommend that you use the data for analysis rather than developing detectors.
- 942,430 Weibo users who take part in the information spread (including reposting, commenting, and liking). We have annotated 407,801 users who are active using a weakly supervised annotator. The weakly supervised annotator is far from perfect (the accuracy of it is only 81.5%). As a result, we recommend that you use relevant data and do not trust the label information.

## Data Structure
MisBot has two subsets: '*Information_Instances*' and '*User_Instances*':
- '*Information_Instances*':
  - '*misinformation.jsonl*': The misinformation instances flagged by the Weibo platform.
  - '*verified_information.jsonl*': The information instances from the verified news accounts.
  - '*trend_information.jsonl*': The information instances from the trend in the Weibo platform.
  - 'imgs.zip': The related images.
  - 'videos.zip': The related videos.
- '*User_Instances*':
  - '*train_data.jsonl*': 99,874 annotated Weibo users that are annotated by human annotators.
  - '*train_data_sampled.jsonl*': The active annotated Weibo users.
  - '*inference_data.jsonl*': The Weibo users who take part in the information spread (including reposting, commenting, and liking).
  - '*inference_labels.json*': The labels of active inference users generated by the weakly supervised annotator.

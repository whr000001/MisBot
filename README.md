# MisBot
Repository for MisBot, a dataset including annotations of misinformation and social bots on Weibo.

We have published the preprocessed data on Baidu Disk: link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EYf_kcI9jn8e0fs4OwlwEA password：i8na


We are considering employing other platforms to uphold MisBot.

Besides, we are working hard to organize the raw data and upload it. Since MisBot is huge and contains a lot of details, feel free to ask me if you have any questions about MisBot.
